    "# Function Placement: The calculate_shipping_cost function was defined at the beginning, but its call was placed outside the try block. This means that if any exceptions occurred during user input (like entering a non-numeric value for weight), the function would still be called, potentially leading to further errors or incorrect output due to undefined variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exception Handling: The try-except block was used to handle potential exceptions like ValueError for user input errors. However, the exception handling within the calculate_shipping_cost function was not integrated with this block. Errors raised within the function (like a KeyError or any other generic exception) were caught separately within the function, but their handling wasn't reflected in the main try-except block.\n",
    "\n",
    "# User Input: The user input was initially placed within the else block after the except block. In Python, the else block in a try-except structure should contain code that runs only if no exceptions occur in the try block. Placing user input here could lead to confusion regarding the flow of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Displaying Errors: The error messages were printed within the function using print, which could lead to multiple error messages being displayed. This might make it difficult for the user to understand the context of the error and where it occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To address these issues, I restructured the code as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Moved the calculate_shipping_cost function inside the try block after obtaining user input. This ensures that any potential errors in obtaining user input are handled before calling the function.\n",
    "# Integrated error handling within the function to return specific error messages (KeyError or general exceptions) rather than using print statements. This allows for better error communication and handling.\n",
    "# Displayed the result or error message after calling the function within the try block, improving the clarity of the output by showing the result or specific error message.\n",
    "# Properly handled the ValueError for user input by catching it separately and providing a clear error message to the user.\n",
    "# Overall, the restructuring aims to create a more organized flow of the program, ensuring that errors are handled effectively and the output is displayed in a clear and understandable manner."
